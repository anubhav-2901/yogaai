Sure! Here are some yoga instructions for a 5-minute relaxing session suitable for beginners:

1. Start by finding a comfortable seated position on your mat or a cushion. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, inhaling and exhaling slowly.
2. Begin with some gentle neck stretches. Slowly tilt your head to the right, feeling a stretch on the left side of your neck. Hold for a few seconds and then switch sides. Repeat this stretch three times on each side.
3. Move on to seated forward folds. Extend your legs in front of you and slowly fold forward, reaching for your toes or ankles. Keep your spine straight and relax into the stretch, feeling a gentle release in your hamstrings and lower back. Hold this position for 30 seconds to one minute.
4. Transition into a seated twist. Bend your right knee and place your right foot outside of your left knee. Place your left elbow on the outside of your right knee and gently twist your torso to the right. Hold this twist for 30 seconds to one minute, breathing deeply. Repeat on the other side.
5. Next, come into a gentle backbend. Lie down on your back and bend your knees, bringing your feet close to your glutes. Place your hands on the ground beside your head and gently press through your palms, lifting your chest and hips off the ground. Keep your gaze upwards and hold this position for 30 seconds, breathing deeply.
6. Finally, end your session in a relaxing pose called Savasana or Corpse pose. Lie flat on your back and allow your legs to relax and fall open. Place your arms by your sides, palms facing up. Close your eyes and take slow, deep breaths, allowing your body and mind to relax completely. Stay in this pose for 2-3 minutes, or as long as you'd like.

Remember to listen to your body and modify any poses or movements that feel uncomfortable or painful. Enjoy your relaxing 5-minute yoga session!
